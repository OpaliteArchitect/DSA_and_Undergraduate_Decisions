# Undergraduate Decisions: C# Console Application Compilation

A collection of C# console applications demonstrating fundamental programming concepts, plus an interactive choice-based narrative game following the life of a college student.

## 📁 Project Structure

### Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Activity1_1** – Raw I/O without arrays or loops (20 individual variables)
- **Activity1_2** – Same functionality using arrays and loops  
- **Activity1_3** – Enhanced version displaying odd-numbered entries first
- **Activity2_1_2_2** – `Student` struct implementation with fields (name, age, birthday, etc.)
- **Activity3_1** – Basic `List<T>` proficiency
- **Activity3_2** – List with fixed capacity (array-like behavior)
- **StackImplementation** – Custom stack data structure
- **QueueImplementation** – Queue implementation

### Classes and Inheritance
- **Classes** – Inheritance hierarchy demonstrating OOP principles

### Creative Output: Undergraduate Decisions
An interactive narrative game following a college freshman's journey. Manage four resources: academic, mental, social, financial.
Follow one of two distinct narrative tracks, each leading to three dramatically different conclusions, offering six possible endings.

*This game is inspired by resource-management choice games like "Lapse: A Forgotten Future".*
